Feature: Search and Sort Games
  As a user
  I want to search for games and sort the results
  So that I can find and organize games matching my search criteria

  Background:
    Given I have the following games:
      | title  | dimensions | source  | publication year | cost |
      | Match Game1  | 2D   | Source1 | 2000             | $10  |
      | Game2  | match      | Source2 | 2014             | $12  |
      | Game3  | 3D         | Match3  | 2020             | $13  |
      | Game4  | 2D         | Source4 | 2000             | $14  |
      | Game5  | match      | Source5 | 2015             | $15  |
